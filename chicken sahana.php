Chicken Sahana

Prep time: 15 min
Cook time: 50 min
Main Ingredients : chicken

Ingredients used:

Chicken - 1 kg, cut into bite sized pieces, washed and drained
Onion - 2 large, finely chopped
Tomato - 1, medium, chopped (optional)
Ginger garlic paste - 1 tbsp
Red chili powder - 1 1/2 to 2 tsps (adjust)
Curry leaves - 1 sprig
Oil - 4 tbsps
Salt to taste
Fresh coriander leaves - for garnish
Shallots - 5 (optional)
Green chilies - 2 (optional)
Fresh coconut - 1/4 cup
Roasted chick peas - 2 tbsps (dalia/putnala pappu) OR roasted peanuts OR cashew nuts - 6-7
Roast for 3-4 mts on low flame:
Cloves - 3
Cinnamon stick - 1/2"
Cardamom - 1
Cumin seeds - 1 tsp
Poppy seeds - 1/2 tsp
Fennel seeds - 1 tsp
Black pepper corns - 1 tsp

Method:

Grind the dry roasted ingredients along with the shallots, green chilis, roasted chickpeas and fresh coconut to a fine paste adding little water. Set aside.Heat oil in a heavy bottomed vessel, once hot, add the chopped onions and curry leaves and saute for 7-8 mts or till they turn lightly brown. Add ginger garlic paste and saute for 5 mts.
Add the red chili powder and chicken pieces and mix. Cook on high flame for 4 mts, mixing once in a while.
Reduce flame, place lid and cook for 15 mts. Add chopped tomatoes and cook with lid for 10 mts on medium flame, mixing once in a while.
Add the ground spice paste and mix well. Cook on medium flame for 3 to 4 mts and add two cups of water and salt. Increase flame and bring to a boil. Now reduce flame, place lid and simmer till the chicken is done. Salna is a watery gravy dish so ensure there is enough liquid. Add more water if required.
Once the chicken is cooked, turn off flame. Remove to a serving bowl and garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
Serve with parotta, biryani, pulao, chapati, appam, dosa or naan.

Tips

If you do not have roasted chickpeas, use peanuts or cashew nuts.Another version of the salna calls for roasting 2 tbsps coriander seeds and 6-7 red chilis along with rest of the ingredients. 
In that case, green chilis and red chili powder can be omitted.You can add cubed potatoes (2 medium sized potato) at step 4.
You can also roast fresh coconut along with other spices.
