Ingredients
Crab - 5-6
Onion - 1 big (finely chopped)
Tomatoes - 2 (finely chopped)
Ginger garlic paste - 1 teaspoon
Green Chillies - 2
Coriander powder - 1 tbsp
Red chilly powder - 1 tbsp
Turmeric powder - 1/2 tsp
Whole Garam Masala - 1 bay leaf, 2" piece cinnamon stick, 2 cloves, 3 cardamoms
Curry Leaves - 1 spring
Cumin seeds - 1 tsp
Fennel seeds - 1 tsp
Oil – 2 tbsp
Cilantro (Coriander Leaves) - handful (finely chopped)
To Grind

Grated Coconut - 1/4 cup
Fennel seeds - 1 tsp

Method

Clean the crab and cut it. Add some salt and keep it aside.
Heat oil in a deep pan (kadai) and temper the whole garam masala, cumin seeds, fennel seeds and curry leaves.
Add the onions and green chillies and fry till it turns golden.
Next fry the ginger garlic paste for a minute.
Add the tomatoes and cook till the tomatoes are mashed up.
Now add the chilly powder, coriander powder and turmeric powder.
Now add the crabs and mix to coat the crabs with the masala.
Add some water depending on how much gravy you need. You can also make it a semi gravy dish.
Cover and let it cook for 5-7 minutes. The crab turns red in color when done. If you overcook the crab it will become stringy.
In the meantime grind the ingredients under 'To grind'.
Add this ground paste to the crab gravy. Check for salt and other seasonings and adjust if needed.
Let the gravy simmer for another 5 minutes for the ground masala to get cooked.
Finally add chopped cilantro and switch off. 

Serving Suggestion
This tastes very good with white rice, dosa, idli, kappa, chapati and parotta.</pre>
