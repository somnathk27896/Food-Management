How to make indian fish kofta curry :

Boil the fish and remove the bones nicely.
Mince the small onion, 4 green chilies, mint, coriander leaves and blend with the fish along with bread, salt and garam masala powder.
Knead to a smooth mixture, form into small balls and deep fry to a golden brown colour. Drain and set aside. Pound together the remaining spices to a fine powder.
Grind onion, ginger and garlic to a paste. Heat 3 table spoons of ghee and fry the ground paste to a golden brown colour.
Put in spices and fry for a couple of seconds, then put in tomatoes and curd.
Cook till the ghee floats to the top. Put in 2 cups of water, mix nicely and cook over a low fire till all the liquid dries. Mash to a smooth paste with the help of a wooden spoon and then pour in 2 more cups of water.
Bring to a rolling boil, reduce heat and simmer gently for 5 minutes.
Put in the fish balls and simmer for 5 more minutes.
Serve fish kofta curry hot garnished with coriander leaves.
