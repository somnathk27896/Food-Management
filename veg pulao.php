2.	soak the rice in enough water for 30 minutes. drain and keep aside.
3.	in a deep thick bottomed pot or pan, heat ghee/oil and fry all the whole spices mentioned above, till the oil becomes fragrant
4.	add the onions and saute them till golden. saute the onions on a low flame and stir often for uniform browning.
5.	add the ginger-garlic-green chili paste and saute for 10 to 12 seconds.
6.	add the tomatoes and saute for 2-3 minutes on a low flame.
7.	add all the veggies and saute again for 2-3 minutes on a low flame.
8.	add drained rice and saute gently for 2 minutes on a low flame, so that the rice gets well coated with the oil.
9.	pour water and stir.
10.	sprinkle 6 to 7 drops of lime juice. season with salt and stir again.
11.	cover tightly and let the rice cook on a low flame, till the water is absorbed and the rice is well cooked. check in between a few times to check if the water is enough. depending on the quality of rice, you may need to add less or more water. with a fork too, you can gently stir the rice without breaking the rice grains.
12.	once the rice grains are cooked, fluff and let the rice stand for 5 minutes.
13.	serve the veg pulao hot with some side salad, sliced onion & lemon wedges or raita. you can also garnish veg pulao with chopped coriander or mint leaves.
notes
if you are making veg pulao in a pressure cooker, then add 2.5 to 3 cups water. for an al dente texture, 2.5 cups is fine and for a softer texture 3 cups water is fine.
