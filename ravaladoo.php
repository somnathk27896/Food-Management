5.	then add sugar. now mix the sugar with the rava.
6.	add cardamom powder and raisins. stir again.
7.	add milk in parts and keep on stirring. mix very well.
8.	once all the milk is absorbed and the sugar has dissolved, remove the pan from fire.
9.	grease your palms with ghee and form ladoos, while the mixture is still hot and you can handle the heat.
10.	make all ladoos this way and store them in an air-tight jar or box.
11.	serve rava ladoos plain or with a glass of milk.
