1 tbsp chopped fresh ginger
4 cloves garlic
1/3 cup vinegar
Salt To Taste
1 tbsp ground coriander seeds
1 tbsp ground cumin seeds

How to make barbequed fish :

Blend together ginger, garlic, vinegar, salt, coriander, cumin, cayenne and oil in the blender to form a fine paste.
Marinate the fish pieces into the paste for about 4 hours in the refrigerator.
Pre-heat the oven on maximum heat at broil.
Cover the oven tray with foil to avoid mess.
Place the marinated fish pieces on the tray and broil for about 8-10 minutes.
Turn over and broil for about 8 minutes again.
Keep a constant check. Broiling time may vary depending on the thickness of fish pieces.
Serve the tandoori fish hot with your favorite chutney.
