1. Heat oil in a deep sauce pan and splutter mustard seeds, cumin seeds and curry leaves. Saute the chopped onions and crushed ginger garlic, till they turn golden brown. 
2. Now add chopped tomatoes along with turmeric powder, chilly powder, corrainder powder, pepper powder, cumin powder, garam masala and salt. Let this mixture cook till we get a nice masala. 
3. Add shrimp and mix well to coat the masala. Add water as needed and let it simmer for few minutes.
