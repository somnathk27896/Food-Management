a pinch of asafoetida/hing
1 to 1.25 cups water, about 250 ml to 275 ml water
2 to 2.5 tbsp oil

salt as required

How to make the recipe:
prepping up:
first rinse, peel and cut the veggies in thick strips or batons. place them in a steamer pan.
then steam the vegetables in an electric cooker, steamer or pressure cooker.
the veggies have to be completely cooked and yet retain their shape.
when the veggies are steaming, gather all the ingredients required for making kolhapuri masala.
heat a pan and on a low flame dry roast the spices - cinnamon, cloves, black peppers, coriander, cumin, stone flower, pinch of nutmeg powder, tej patta, nagkesar (cobra's saffron), red chilies, green cardamoms and black cardamom seeds. skip stone flower, nagkesar and poppy seeds, if you don't have these.
once the spices become fragrant, then add poppy seeds, sesame seeds and desiccated coconut.
stir continuously and dry roast till the desiccated coconut gets golden.
once the spice mixture cools, then take them in a dry grinder or coffee grinder.
grind to a fine powder. a slight semi fine powder is also fine. the sesame seeds & coconut will release oil while grinding. so you have to scrape the sides of the masala and grind. if difficult to grind, then add some water and make a fine paste.
preparing veg kolhapuri:
heat oil in a pan and add chopped onions.
saute the onions till they are light golden or golden.
add ginger and garlic paste.
stir and then add chopped coriander leaves. stir and saute till the raw aroma of the ginger garlic goes away.
next add chopped tomatoes.
saute till the tomatoes soften and you see oil leaving the sides.
add turmeric powder, red chili powder and asafoetida.
stir and then add chopped bell pepper/capsicum. you can also skip capsicum if you prefer.
stir and saute till the capsicum is half cooked and yet having a slight crunch. about 5 to 6 minutes on a low flame.
add the ground kolhapuri masala.
stir and saute for some seconds.
then add water. season with salt.
bring the curry to a simmer.
when you see some oil floating on top, add the steamed veggies.
stir and simmer for about 2 minutes.
lastly add chopped coriander leaves and give a final stir. you can also garnish veg kolhapuri with the coriander leaves.
serve veg kolhapuri with soft chapatis, phulkas or parathas. you can also serve this spicy veg curry with bread and steamed rice.
